    <h1 align="center">Beat Saber Twitter</h1>
</p>
<p align="center">
  ... is a mod for the game Beat Saber, that allows you to chat and interact with other players in-game. With future plans including sharing of things like scores and multiplayer lobbies and interactions like quick matches.
  <p align="center" style="color: #ffffff50">Despite the name, this mod has nothing to do with Twitter nor do you need an account on any of those platforms</br>
The mod just happens to be called like that (for now).</p>
